# POKEDEX

### Jxpert - software development training - JAKALA

-----

Final project of the software development training at Jxpert conducted by the company Jakala.
The project consists of a Pokédex that gathers information from the POKEAPI and displays it to users along with type and generation filters.
The important aspect of the project, beyond the Pokédex itself, was to develop high-quality and easily scalable software, based on a hexagonal architecture for project organization, ensuring good test coverage.
